This project focuses on predicting an individual's health risk level using a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier. The prediction is based on three key lifestyle factors: Body Mass Index (BMI), the number of hours exercised per week, and the weekly frequency of junk food consumption. The dataset used for this project, health_risk.csv, contains 100 entries and includes four columns: bmi, exercise_hours, junk_food_freq, and risk_level. The risk_level column is the target variable, representing one of three categories—low, medium, or high—which is encoded into numeric values for modeling purposes.

The model uses the Random Forest algorithm from the scikit-learn library, which is known for its robustness and ability to handle classification tasks effectively. The features used in the model include BMI, exercise hours, and junk food frequency, while the target variable is the encoded health risk level. The script splits the dataset into training and testing subsets, trains the model on the training data, and evaluates its performance using a classification report and a confusion matrix. Additionally, a feature importance plot is generated to visually highlight which input variables contribute most to the prediction.

To run this project, you’ll need Python along with the following libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. After installing the necessary dependencies, simply place the health_risk.csv file in your working directory and execute the script. Upon running, you’ll receive a detailed performance summary of the model as well as a plot showing the importance of each feature.

This project provides a foundational example of how machine learning can be applied in the health domain to assess risk factors based on lifestyle data. It's particularly useful for students, data science beginners, and professionals interested in health analytics. The modular code structure also makes it easy to extend—for instance, by incorporating additional features like age or sleep hours, or by switching to more advanced models such as gradient boosting or neural networks.

Beyond its predictive capabilities, this project encourages data-driven thinking in personal health management. By understanding which habits most influence health risks, individuals can make more informed decisions about their daily routines. Moreover, healthcare professionals could potentially use similar models for preventive diagnostics. With further development, this tool could evolve into a personalized risk assessment application.
